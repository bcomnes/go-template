# Contributing

## Guidelines

- Patches, ideas, and changes are welcome.
- Bug fixes are almost always welcome.
- New features are sometimes welcome:
  - Please open an issue to discuss the idea **before** investing significant time.
  - The proposal may be rejected.
  - If youâ€™d rather skip the discussion and jump straight into implementation, be prepared to maintain a fork if the idea is respectfully declined.
- Please follow the style of the existing code.
- All tests must pass.
- New features or code paths must include tests.
- Aim for 100% test coverage.
- Questions are welcome! However, unless there is an official support contract in place, support is not guaranteed.
- Contributors reserve the right to walk away from the project at any time, with or without notice.
